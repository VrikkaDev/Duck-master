# Duck Mod
## [MaLilib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib) IS REQUIRED FOR CLIENT!
Duck Mod is a server-client mod. In other words, must installed on the server and the client for features to be accessed.

## Default Open Config GUI:
Y+C

# This project is in serious need of rewriting :)

## Features:
**Block entity peaking**: see block entity contents without opening their inventory.  
Works for all block entities that have an inventory, including Furnaces.

**Furnace XP display**: see the current amount of XP stored in Furnaces, Blast Furnaces, and Smokers

**Bee block fill level display**: see the fill level of Bee Nests and Hives

**Player inventory peaking**: inspect players inventory

**Villager trade peaking**: inspect a villager's trades

All features are configurable to use desired keybinds on client, but all functionalities require an OP'ed player to set desired features as `OP not needed` or `OP needed`
